## Introduction

In this project, we leverage a CNN architecture to perform binary image classification on medical images. The model is trained to distinguish between images with tumors ('yes') and those without tumors ('no').

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   

2. Install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the codebase and datasets.

## Usage

To train the model, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python main_script.py
   ```

This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and generate visualizations.

## Data Visualization

Explore the distribution of images before and after splitting the dataset by using the visualize_image_distribution and visualize_data functions, respectively.

## Model Training

The model consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers. It is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model on the validation set and visualize the training and validation accuracy/loss using the generated plots. A confusion matrix is also displayed to assess the model's performance.

## Testing

Test the trained model on the provided test set and view the test loss and accuracy.

## Sample Image Visualization

Visualize a grid of sample images from the training set using the visualize_img function.
   ```bash
   python show_img.py
   ```

## Image Resizing

Resize images in the dataset using the resize_images function.
   ```bash
   python normalize.py
   ```
